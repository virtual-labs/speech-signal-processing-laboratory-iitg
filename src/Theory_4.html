<p style="text-align: justify;">Speech generated from the speech production system consists of a  sequence of basic sound units of a particular language. The need for  studying the basic alphabet set (orthographic representation) of any  language is to be able to express message in written form. On the  similar lines we need to study the basic sound units set ( acoustic  representation) of any language for producing message in oral form.  Every language is provided with unique set of alphabet set and sound  units set. In most of the Indian languages we have about 40-50 distinct  alphabets set and also of nearly same number of sound units set.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next question is, will this small set of 40-50 distinct sound units  is sufficient to convey all the messages. Yes, it is indeed. Just like  we form words and sentences in written form with permutations and  combination of alphabet units, we can form words, phrases and sentences  in oral form with the permutation and combination of different sound  units. However it needs to be emphasized that all permutation and  combination may not convey a valid messages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The process of learning to speak in a particular languages involves  getting to know about the valid combination that have some meaning and  then using them in proper order, resulting in what is called speech  signal. Whether the remaining is formal and informal, over time we get  hold into the basic sound units of a particular language and some words  that enable us to produce speech in a particular language, with respect  to time the vocabulary of words in that languages increases. Thus one of  the important steps in speech processing is to get a feel about the  different sounds used for speech production.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From signal processing point of view we need to get a feel of the time  domain, frequency domain and time-frequency representations of these  sounds. Perceptually we have been exposed to different sounds of mother  tongue day in and day out and we agree that we can discriminate them  based on their perceptual difference. Now it is time to look at them  from signal processing point of view. As will be evident later it is  indeed observable that the different sounds have different time,  frequency and time-frequency representations and hence make them  perceptually distinct.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Classification of Sound units in Indian Languages:</span></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/experiment4-theory-figure1.jpg" alt="">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1 shows the classification of sound units in Indian languages. Description of each of the categories is as follows:</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Vowels and Consonants:</span></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sound units of most languages in India are broadly classified into  two categories, namely, vowels and consonants. These two broad  categories are mainly based on the shape of the vocal tract. In case of  vowels, the vocal tract shape is wide open without any constriction  along its length starting from the glottis till the lips and is excited  by voiced excitation source. Alternatively, in case of consonants, their  may be constriction in vocal tract shape some where along its length  and is excited by either voiced, unvoiced and both types of excitation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Figure 2 shows example of a vowel sound unit (|a|) and consonant sound  unit (|s|). As can be observed the time domain representation i.e.,  waveform of the two signals are different. The spectra of the two cases  are different. Finally the time-varying spectral representation is also  different for different cases. Even though these two examples  are two  extreme cases of vowel and consonant, they help us in appreciating the  differences between vowels and consonants.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/experiment4-theory-fig2.jpg" alt="">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;Figure 2: Comparison of vowels and consonants</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Short vowels, Long vowels and Diphthongs</span></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="content" style="text-align: justify;">In most of the Indian languages, the vowel sound  units are further classified into three categories as short vowels, long  vowels and diphthongs. From the production process point of view there  is no distinction between short and long vowels, except that the  duration of production will be longer, typically nearly double that of  short vowels. For instance short vowel /a/ may be almost half the  duration as that of the long vowel /A/. In case of diphthongs, as the  name indicates, two vowel sounds are produced in succession without any  pause. The production process is such that the vocal tract shape is  initially producing the first vowel and midway during the production of  the first vowel it changes the shape to produce the other vowel .</p>
<p class="content" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="content" style="text-align: justify;">Figure 3 shows the plots of a short vowel |a|, its  long vowel |A|, short vowel |i| and diphthong |ai|. The duration of long  vowel |A| is longer than that of the short vowel |a|. However, the time  domain waveform and spectra are same for both the cases. Even the time  varying spectral information is also same in both the cases. In case of  diphthongs |ai|, the initial portion materials with |a| and the later  portion material with |i|. One transition of vocal tract shape from |a|  to |i| can be clearly seen in the time varying spectral plot.</p>

<h2><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Stop consonants</span></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stop consonants form the major category of consonants in Indian  languages. During the production of these consonants the vocal tract is  completely closed at some point, somewhere along the length of the vocal  tract and suddenly released. Hence the name stop consonants. The stop  consonants are further classified into different cases based on two  criteria, namely, place of articulation (POA) and manner of  articulation(MOA). The POA gives the portion along the length of the  vocal tract where it is completely closed. MOA gives the manner used for  exciting the vocal tract synthesis, namely, voicing and aspiration.  Table 1 gives the classification of different stop consonants in  majority of the Indian languages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/experiment4-theory-table1.jpg" alt="">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;Table 1: classification of stop consonants in majority of the Indian languages</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In majority of the Indian languages we use voicing and aspiration as  manner of articulation. Accordingly we have four possibilities, unvoiced  unaspirated(UVUA), unvoiced aspirated(UVA), voiced unaspirated (VUA)  and voiced aspirated(VA). Hence we can group the stop consonants based  on most into four categories as given in Table 1. The POA has typically  five places of articulation in majority of the Indian languages. They  are velar, palatal, alveolar, dental and bilabial. Among these the  palatal POA stop consonants are categorized separately as affricates  that will be described later. Thus we have four POA for the sounds of  stop consonants. The stop consonants can also be grouped into four  categories based on the POA. Accordingly in total we have about 4X4=16  stop consonants. Each of these stop consonants can be uniquely described  in terms of MOA ans POA categories. For instances, the stop consonants  |k| is characterized by UVUA MOA &amp; velar POA. Further, the subset of  stop consonants under the same category of MOA &amp; POA will have same  excitation characteristics and places, respectively. For instances, all  stop consonants under UVUA MOA will have same MOA i.e. unvoicing &amp;  unaspiration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">MOA</span></span></h2>
<p>Vibration of vocal folds is a major excitation source during speech  production. However, sound units, specifically, consonants may be  produced using other types of unvoiced excitation like burst and  frication. Accordingly the excitation can be either voiced and unvoiced.  Further, aspiration is an important MOA in majority of Indian  languages. The sound units produced using these MOA have different  meanings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">POA</span></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the production of stop consonants we will obstruct the vocal tract  at different places along its length. These places are termed as POA.  Stop consonants are therefore classified based on the POA also. As the  different POA names given in Table 1 indicates, the POA will be in  velar, alveolar, dental &amp; bilabial regions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Velar Stop Consonants</span></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this category the total constriction for the production of stop  consonants occur at the velar region. In case of UVUA velar stop  consonants |k|, there is no voicing and also aspiration. The only  excitation is a burst of small duration, typically of about 5-20 msec.  The two events that are present in the UVUA velar stop consonants is a  closure region during which there is no speech activity and then the  burst region where there will be sudden release of the closure. The time  domain waveform spectrum and time-varying spectra are given in Figure  4(a). The closure region is a silence region, difficult to distinguish  from the non-speech region followed by a burst region.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/experiment4-theory-fig4a.jpg" alt="">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 4(a):Temporal, spectral and time varying spectra of UVUA velar stop consonant /k/</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Compare to UVUA velar stop consonants, UVA stop consonants will have  three events, namely, closure &amp; burst as in the case of UVUA &amp;  also aspiration event in addition. The closure &amp; burst events will  have similar class as in the UVUA case. The aspiration is due to the  frication at the glottis region. The aspiration region can be identified  as the noise like region after the burst region. Figure 4(b) shows the  time domain, frequency domain &amp; time-varying spectra for the velar  UVA stop consonants.</p>

<p class="contentEquation" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="contentEquation">The VUA velar stop consonants will be same as UVUA, except that the  unvoicing is replaced by a voiced excitation. Due to this there will be a  low amplitude voicing bar in both the closure and burst regions. Figure  4(c) shows the time domain, frequency domain and time-varying spectra  of a velar UVA stop consonants. The only difference with reference to  UVUA is the presence of low amplitude nearly periodic signal in the time  domain. The low level voicing bar will be manifested as the low  frequency spectral energy in the frequency domain. The time-varying  spectra shows two different spectral information, one representing the  closure region &amp; the other representing the burst region.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" class="content">The VA velar stop consonants is same as UVA velar  stop consonants, except that unvoicing is replaced by a voicing process.  Due to this there will be a voicing bar in the closure, burst &amp;  aspiration regions. Figure 4(d) shows the time domain, frequency domain  and time varying spectra of a velar VA stop consonant. The only  difference in all the three plots is the additional information due to  the voicing process.</p>

<h2><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Alveolar Stop Consonants</span></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The total constriction of the vocal tract occurs at the alveolar ridge  in this case. This category will also have four different stop  consonants based on the MOA. The alveolar UVUA stop consonants  production will be same as that of velar UVUA stop consonants except  that the place of constriction is at the alveolar ridge. The change in  the place of constriction will have effect mainly on the manifestation  of burst region. The energy associated with the burst region &amp; hence  the prominence depends on the POA. The POA will in turn give knowledge  how much burst oral cavity is present after release of is this cavity,  then will be the energy associates with the burst &amp; its prominence.  Accordingly the burst region in case of alveolar stop consonants is  relatively less prominent compared to the burst in case of velar stop  consonants. In the time domain the burst region will have less energy  and accordingly the spectral energy. Except for the change in the POA,  there is no change in other aspects for the alveolar stop consonants.  Accordingly alveolar UVA, VUA &amp; VA stop consonants will have similar  characteristics as that of their velar counterparts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Figure 4(e) to 4(h) shows the time domain, frequency domain &amp; time  varying spectra of different alveolar stop consonants. At the grass  level their characteristics remain same as that of respective velar stop  consonants. The less prominence of burst regions can be observed by  comparing respective consonants with that of velar case.</p>

<h2><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Dental Stop Consonants</span></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The POA will be dental region. The frontal cavity after the constriction  will be further less and negligible compared to alveolar case. Hence  the manifestation of burst region is very feeble in case of dental stop  consonants. Apart from this there is no difference in the production  compared to alveolar and velar stop consonants. Figure 4(i) to 4(l)  shows different dental stop consonants in the time, frequency and  time-frequency domains. The energy associated with burst region is still  less compared to the alveolar case. This is reflected in the frequency  domain also. The concentration of energy in the time varying spectra is  in different region compared to alveolar &amp; velar cases.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The POA is the two lips region &amp; hence the name in the case of  bilabial stop consonants. Since there is no frontal cavity after the  POA, the burst region is not manifestated in case of bilabial stop  consonants. However, the total closure &amp; release of leads to the  percception of bilabial stop consonants. Figure 4(m) to 4(p) shows the  four bilabial stop consonants. As it can be observed there is no  manifestation of burst region in time, frequency and time varying  spectral plots.</p>

<h2><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Fricatives</span></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">The fricatives are the consonants produced by a narrow constriction  somewhere along the length of the vocal tract. The basic difference  between fricatives and stop consonants is that the closure will be  partial &amp; narrow in case of fricatives &amp; is complete in case of  stop consonants. Depending on the place of narrow constrictions, we have  different fricatives. In case of most Indian languages we have |s|,  |sh|, |shh| &amp; |h| as the fricatives. |s| is a dental fricative, |sh|  is an alveolar fricative, |shh| is also an alveolar fricative but with  more stress and |h| is a velar fricative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Figure 5(a) to 5(d) shows the four fricatives present in most of the  Indian languages. The time domain nature remains same for all the cases,  but differ mainly in the amplitude levels and duration. The  concentration of energy will be in different regions of the spectrum  &amp; hence their difference in the perceptual quality. The time varying  spectra do not show that variation in the concentration of spectral  energy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">The affricates are the consonants where the production involves  combination of stop and fricative consonant production. Initially, the  vocal tract will be completely closed somewhere all the length to create  a total constrictions. After this, the constriction will be partially  released to create a fricative excitations. Most of the Indian languages  have |ch|, |chh|, |j| &amp; |jh| as the affricate consonants. All these  affricates are produced at the palatal region. The difference across  different affricates is due to different MOA. Figure 5(e) to 5(h) shows  the four affricates present in most of the Indian languages. The time  domain nature remains same for all the cases, but differ mainly in the  amplitude levels &amp; duration. The concentration of energy will be in  different regions of the spectrum  &amp; hence their difference. The  time varying spectra do not show that variation in the concentration of  spectral energy.</p>
